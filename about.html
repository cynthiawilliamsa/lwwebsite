        <p>After living a very full life of many experiences including 27 years cumulative total of marriage, late adult
          single life, building two successful companies and parenting 4 children to adulthood, I looked in the
          mirror and said to myself, what would I LOVE to be doing? The answer…helping others understand their
          dreams, desires, longings and discontents. As a Life Coach, my desire is to help you discover YOU and
          take action to live a life you would love living every single day. Let’s get started today because tomorrow
          is not guaranteed! What are you waiting for?</p>

      <section class="section-services section-dark about-first">
        <p>Coaching is about discovering awareness and choices, and a way to empower people to find their own answers within themselves. The coach’s job is to work with clients to help them articulate their dreams, desires and aspirations. Coaches then help
          clients clarify their mission, purpose and goals, and guide them on the path to achieving their desired outcomes. Rather than giving answers, coaches ask the right questions to invite personal discovery and provide support so clients can make
          their own choices. A coach listens to clients on a deep level, not only to what they say, but how they say it, and what’s not being said. A coach then asks powerful questions to encourage a client to discover the answers within themselves. People
          have the power to make decisions in their life. Some just need a little help bringing it to the surface, and the encouragement to take action. The overall goal is to keep moving forward. You have to win a lot of mini-battles before you can win
          the war. It is with a coach in an open, honest and positive relationship in a safe environment that the answers can be found. COACHING ALLOWS CLIENTS TO LIVE MORE FULLY IN A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE. AFTER ALL, A FULFILLING
          LIFE IS A VALUED LIFE. YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY AND ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS!</p>

        <p>Effective coaching looks inside a person's life, encourages inner connection and offers hands-on instruction on how the individuals perceive the world. This critical aspect of coaching is the only way to attain lasting and sustainable change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Once a foundation is laid, focus shifts to establshinging your roadmap to success. Each area of your life is examined to ensure it matches your vision. The end product allows you to leave feeling complete and on your way to an amazing life.</p>
